            # BashPad specific code is modified to work with zsh        #
            # In order to run it, copy this file as .zshrc to *any* dir #
            # other than $HOME, I prefer ~/.config, and then launch your#
            # terminal as                                               #
            # ZDOTDIR=~/.config <terminal command goes here>            #
            #                                     - ppurka              #
            # It differs from original BashPad in the following ways    #
            # 1. There is no RUNDIALOG used. Instead we use the inherent#
            #    capability to zsh to source .zshrc from the directory  #
            #    specified by ZDOTDIR                                   #
            # 2. inputrc files are not needed. bindkeys do the needful  #
            # 3. I don't know how to use MENUCOMPLETE in zsh :(         #
            # 4. We don't need the HISTFILE swapping                    #
            #-----------------------------------------------------------#
            
            #-------------------- Bugs/Todo ----------------------------#
            # 1. Figure out how to disable menu-completion in zsh       #
            #    That is, we want <Tab> to only cycle through the       #
            #    different completion options without invoking the menu.#
            #    Update: Now we don't need to press <tab> twice         #
            #            So, it will work fine in 1-line terminals too  #
            # 2. ^C does not quit                                       #
            #-----------------------------------------------------------#

# Changes in v0.3
#  - Use Alt+Enter to invert default runwatch choice.
#
# Changes in v0.2:
#  - Runwatch uses a temporary file now instead of a subshell,
#    making its memory footprint smaller.
